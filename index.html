                    Having been born and raised in El Paso, Texas, I grew to love the desert air and plant life. Moving to Austin, afforded me the opportunity to expand my horizons, learn how to swim, and enjoy the Texas Hill Country. I think Austin will always be &#8220;home&#8221; for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I left El Paso to attend the University of Texas at Austin where I majored in Advertising. I have always enjoyed art, design, architecture, and typography. Having exposure and the ability to work in these arenas has been satisfying. I spent over ten years working in Educational Publishing in collaboration with Editorial and Design teams. As such, I have extensive experience with content and digital management systems.

                    In recent years, I have moved into software development and specifically in a Business Analyst role. I have worked on top-notch projects involving such national clients as: Cengage Learning, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Taylor & Francis, NIKE, Copyright Clearance Center, and Shire Pharmaceuticals. My journey now takes me to the land of web development where I intend to utilize my past experiences and hone my craft.
